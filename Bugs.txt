BUG# 000       PRIORITY: Med        DATE: 10/28
TITLE: Screen vanishes when Tab is pressed for the first time
STEPS TO REPLICATE:
1. Open BasicScreenTest.py

NOTES:  Subsequent Tab keys will not make the screen vanish again


BUG# 001       PRIORITY: Low       DATE: 10/28
TITLE: TextBox widget not properly highlighting full width of widget
STEPS TO REPLICATE:
1. Highlight TextBox widget object (BasicScreenTest.py is a good place to do this)
2. Hit Enter - the widget background does not change to highlighted
3. Enter text - the text entered will be properly highlighted, but the remaining width of the widget will not
NOTES:  I suspect the problem is with the SetDisplayText() method
