BUG# 000       PRIORITY: Med        DATE: 10/28
TITLE: Screen vanishes when Tab is pressed for the first time
STEPS TO REPLICATE:
1. Open BasicScreenTest.py
2. Hit Tab - screen should go blank except for cursor location
3. Hit Tab a second time - screen will come back
NOTES:  Subsequent Tab keys will not make the screen vanish again
Suspect this is because BaseScreen.py calls each widget's panel's show() method instead of the widget's Show()


***FIXED***
BUG# 001       PRIORITY: Low       DATE: 10/28
TITLE: TextBox widget not properly highlighting full width of widget
STEPS TO REPLICATE:
1. Highlight TextBox widget object (BasicScreenTest.py is a good place to do this)
2. Hit Enter - the widget background does not change to highlighted
3. Enter text - the text entered will be properly highlighted, but the remaining width of the widget will not
NOTES:  I suspect the problem is with the SetDisplayText() method
Fixed 10/30


***FIXED***
BUG# 002       PRIORITY: Low        DATE: 10/28
TITLE: Cursor disappears when entering text into TextBox widget

***FIXED***
BUG# 003       PRIORITY: High       DATE: 10/29
TITLE: DataTable window does not display at correct Y, X position
STEPS TO REPLICATE: 
NOTES:
Trying to put a DataTable widget at position 0, X causes a segmentation fault.
DataTable at different Y, X position will cause it to actually be position Y * 2, X * 2
Cursor is at position Y, X
FIXED 10/30
