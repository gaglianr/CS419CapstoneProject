Jeff -- 

1. CDBCore uses static methods while requesting access to class variables such as stdscr, ConnectionString, etc?
   More importantly, shouldn't CDBCore use standard class patterns (__init__, instance methods) considering
   that CDBCore must contain variable data (such as different History or CurrentScreens, etc)?
   -- I switched CDBCore to standard class style, but saved the previous one as CDBCore.bak in case
   I shouldn't have.
2. Any idea why I have to instantiate CDBCore by calling CDBCore.CDBCore() even after importing it via
   "from CDBCore import CDBCore"? The instance is triple nested (CDBCore.CDBCore.CDBcore).
3. Home Screen basic layout -- Maybe 1 label with name of Program, then multiple buttons. Maybe: 
	Label: Welcome Message
	Button: Connection Wizard 
	Button: Main Menu
	Button: Instructions/Help
	?
4. I can only import CDBCore by changing that directory's __init__.py file to contain
    "from CDBCore import CDBCore". Worried that will break compatibility with your environments.
