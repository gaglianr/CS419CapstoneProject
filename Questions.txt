Jeff -- 

1. Can't call Label.__init__ with text value that includes \n
2. PopUp might need access to Screen? To Show/Hide other widgets when it's called.
2a. Alternatively -- Screen has special logic for PopUp?
2b. Alternatively -- PopUp just pads with whitespace?
3. What are PopUpOkCancel and PopUpYesNoCancel? Design document doesn't specify, PopUp only listed
as text field + requirement to press enter to dismiss.
