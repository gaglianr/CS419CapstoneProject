Software Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The following software is required:
  Linux OS (Debian/CentOS/Ubuntu officially supported)
  Python 2.6
  Python psycopg2 module
  Python mysql.connector module

  The following software is recommended:
  MySQL
  PostgreSQL

  
Software Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Installation instructions are included here for a full installation from 
  scratch using a Debian based system.  Other Linux distributions will be able 
  to run the application, but steps will be different for obtaining MySQL, 
  PostgreSQL, Psycopg, and mysql.connector libraries.  The concept remains the 
  same. You will need root access to fully complete the installation. If you do 
  not use ‘sudo’, make sure to run the sudo commands under a root account instead.

    1.	Begin by fully installing a basic Debian system. 
        (Desktop environment is optional.)

    2.	Perform a full system update/upgrade.
	  sudo apt-get update
	  sudo apt-get upgrade

    3.	Install MySQL (If PostgreSQL is desired instead, skip to step 5.)
	  sudo apt-get install mysql-server

    4.	Test your installation.  When prompted Enter the password you created 
        during installation.  (If you skipped step 3, move on to step 5.) 
	  mysql –u root –p

    5.	Install PostgreSQL (if MySQL was installed, this step is optional. 
        Skip to step 7.)
	  sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-client

    6.	Open the PSQL shell and add a password to the default postgres user. 
        Also add a database to use later. (If you skipped step 5, move on to step 7.) 
	  sudo –u postgres psql
	  ALTER USER postgres password ‘<ENTER A PASSORD HERE’>;
	  CREATE DATABASE <DBNAME>;

    7.	Install the Psycopg Python module.
	  sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2

    8.	Install the python-mysql.connector module.
	  sudo apt-get install python-mysql.connector

    9.	Place the CursesDatabase.py file and ‘app’ directory in a location on the 
        newly setup Debian machine that a user can access to run the program.

        
Running the Application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    To start the application, open a terminal, and navigate to the directory where CursesDatabase.py is located. Run:
	  python CursesDatabase.py

	  
User Controls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The user navigates the interface by using navigation commands.  

  Change widget (TAB): 
    Pressing <TAB> cycles through the widgets for a given screen.

  Activate a Widget (ENTER): 
    Pressing <ENTER> activates the currently highlighted widget.

    Textbox: Pressing <ENTER> initiates text capture mode, where a user can enter text.  
             Pressing <ENTER> again puts the text box back into read only mode.

    Checkbox: Pressing <ENTER> toggles the checkbox on or off.

    Button: Pressing <ENTER> executes the action associated with the button.

  Go to Menu (SHIFT + M):
    Pressing <SHIFT  + M> takes the user to the main menu.  
    From here, <TAB> and <ENTER> can be used to navigate the menu like any other
    screen.  Pressing <SHIFT + M> again will return control to the current main screen.

  Go to Status Screen (SHIFT + L):
    Pressing <SHIFT  + L> takes the user to the status screen, where a running log of 
    statuses are kept.  From here, the user can press <W> to move up an entry in the 
    log, or <S> to move down an entry in the log.  On any entry, the user can 
    press <ENTER> to open a popup showing the full log entry.  Pressing <SHIFT + L> 
    again will return control to the current main screen.

  Datatable Navigation (ASDW):
    The contents of a datatable navigated through the <A>, <S>, <D>, and <W> keys.
    <A>: Move left one cell
    <S>: Move down one cell
    <D>: Move right one cell 
    <W>: Move up one cell
